## linux-network-troubleshoot

### Description

This is a set of interactive exercises to help learn about Linux network
troubleshooting. You are presented with a shell in a 'client' container which
is trying to connect to a 'server' container, but there is a networking issue
to solve first. Once you can reach the server, you're finished and can move to
the next level.

### Running

Ensure you have docker-compose and docker installed. Run the `start.sh` script
in level1 to begin. Avoid looking in the Dockerfile.client if you don't want a
spoiler!
